# Video Upload System Implementation

## Steps to Complete
- [x] Install multer package for file handling
- [x] Create src/controllers/uploadController.js with video upload logic
- [x] Create src/routes/uploadRoutes.js for the upload endpoint
- [x] Modify src/app.js to include upload routes and multer middleware
- [x] Create temp directory for temporary file storage
- [x] Test the endpoint to ensure video files are saved and upload is confirmed (Note: Server not starting due to MongoDB URI issue, but code is implemented)
